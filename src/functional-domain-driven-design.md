## Make development boring process and exiting journey.

### Why it matters:

- Brings domain upfront.
- Develop language development team and stakeholders understand.
- Separate infrastructure responsibilities.

### Going deeper:

- Today's talk focus on *strategy*, or the why on decision making.
- It is a sequel to my last year *tactics* [devbg talk](https://github.com/dpopchev/gilded-rose-kata).
- Will use my own case study, one on the modern science cutting edge.
- Will touch base with topics:

    - Machine Learning
    - Application of data structures
    - Design patterns
    - Type hints
    - Good practices
    - Data science
