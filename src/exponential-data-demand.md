### Gravitational wave detection

- Data processing took several months.
- Signal lasted $0.2$ seconds
- Two BHs $\sim 30 \times M_{sun}$ merging $d \sim 1.3\times10^9$ ly
- $5.1 \sigma$ or $99.99997\%$ confidence

- $10$ day observation
- $2$ years data processing

### Bottom line:

General relativity remains one of the best models made by human kind!

## Universe is expanding faster, than expected...

### Open questions

- What is dark matter?
- What is dark energy?
- How to quantize gravity?

**Bottom Line** Although physics is not emergent, being able to quickly compute
is a must have.

### Growing discrepancy of Hubble constant value

## ...and the computational demand grows too.

### Why it matters:

- Different data sources -- different format.
- More often the software solutions are fragile.
- Problem is not limited to science.

### Bottom line:

Modern problems require modern solutions, e.g. write $foo$ such that it maps
an elements, called inputs, from domain $X$ to some elements, called outputs,
from codomain $Y$.
