# Functional Domain Driven Design

## Introduction

Make development boring process and exiting journey.

**Why it matters:**

- Brings domain upfront.
- Develop language development team and stakeholders understand.
- Separate infrastructure responsibilities.

**Go deeper:**

- Today's talk focus on *strategy*, or the why on decision making.
- It is a sequel to my last year *tactics* [devbg talk](https://github.com/dpopchev/gilded-rose-kata).
- Will use my own case study, one on the modern science cutting edge.
- Will touch base with topics:

  - Machine Learning
  - Application of data structures
  - Design patterns
  - Type hints
  - Good practices
  - Data science

## Agenda

- Fundamental .
- Domain Driven Design.
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation.
- Type hints as test driven development shortcuts.
